Messing around with an algoritm that re-arranges equations

There's an online demo available: https://portal.tomwimmenhove.com/algeblah/demo.html

Here's an example of it's usage:

> p1 = 1; v1 = 2; t1 = 3; p2 = 4; v2 = 5
  p1 = 1
  v1 = 2
  t1 = 3
  p2 = 4
  v2 = 5
> solve t2: p1 * v2 / t1 = p2 * v2 / t2
  p2 * v2 / (p1 * v2 / t1) = 12
> t2
  t2 = 12

> b = 4; c = 5
  b = 4
  c = 5
> solve a: a^2 + b^2 = c^2
  sqrt(c ^ 2 - b ^ 2) = 3

  p2 = 100
> db = 20
